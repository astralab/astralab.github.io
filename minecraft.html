									<h1>About Minecraft</h1>
									<p>Minecraft is a sandbox video game created and designed by Swedish game designer Markus "Notch" Persson, and later fully developed and published by Mojang. The creative and building aspects of Minecraft enable players to build constructions out of textured cubes in a 3D procedurally generated world. Other activities in the game include exploration, resource gathering, crafting, and combat. Multiple gameplay modes are available, including a survival mode where the player must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, a creative mode where players have unlimited resources to build with and the ability to fly, an adventure mode where players can play custom maps created by other players, and a spectator mode where players can freely move throughout a world without being affected by gravity or collisions. The PC version of the game is noted for its modding scene, where a dedicated community creates new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets for the game.</p>

								<p>Minecraft has received praise from critics, and won numerous awards and accolades. Social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise and the MineCon convention played large roles in popularising the game. It has been used in education environments, especially in the realm of computing systems, as virtual computers and hardware devices have been built in it. As of February 2017, over 121 million copies have been sold across all platforms, making it the second best-selling video game of all time, behind only the various releases of Tetris. In September 2014, Microsoft announced a deal to buy Mojang and the Minecraft intellectual property for US$2.5 billion, with the acquisition completed two months later. Other games in the franchise, such as Minecraft: Story Mode, have since been released.</p>
